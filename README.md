# refactor-horiseon

## Description
A marketing agency wanted to make an already existing webpage more accessible and optimized for search engines. Opening the source code of the page, I immediately noticed there were no semantic HTML elements or alternative texts for images (alt). With further investigation, I noticed the heading elements were not sequentially ordered and one link in the navigation didn’t work. So, I changed all div elements with semantic HTML elements relative to their position and function. Next, I added a title and alt tags to each image to increase accessibility. Then, I changed the heading elements so they were ordered h1 at the top to h4 at the bottom. Next, I added an ID tag to the “search engine optimization” section, fixing the broken navigation link. Lastly, I added comments to the code to make it more readable for future reference. I learned it was possible to add alternative text to the html elements for background images in the CSS file.
