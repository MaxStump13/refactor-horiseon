# refactor-horiseon
## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
A marketing agency wanted to make an already existing webpage more accessible and optimized for search engines. Opening the source code of the page, I immediately noticed there were no semantic HTML elements or alternative texts for images (alt). With further investigation, I noticed the heading elements were not sequentially ordered and one link in the navigation didn‚Äôt work. So, I changed all <div> elements with semantic HTML elements relative to their position and function. Next, I added a title and alt tags to each image to increase accessibility. Then, I changed the heading elements so they were ordered <h1> at the top to <h4> at the bottom. Next, I added an ID tag to the ‚Äúsearch engine optimization‚Äù section, fixing the broken navigation link. Lastly, I added comments to the code to make it more readable for future reference. I learned it was possible to add alternative text to the html elements for background images in the CSS file.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
